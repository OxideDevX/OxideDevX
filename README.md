### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I`m OxideDevX, in real life my name is Alexander.

- Intern cybersecurity specialist.

- Python and C/C++ programmer(intern).
- Intern Arduino specialist(1 project).

And although I am just learning how to create my own software products and just entering the field of information security and information technology, I want to give advice to all those who are starting to program and work with computers in general. 
Never stop self-learning! Knowledge and experience is power!
